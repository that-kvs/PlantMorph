**CORRESPONDENCE FINDING MODULE**

CorrespondenceAlgoInput --> Contains the preprocessed Genus-0 Input Meshes for which the pairwise correspondence is to be found.

landmarks.zip --> Contains the vertex ids of the landmarks used in our experiment for all pairs in the format of x1.pinned and x2.pinned, where x is the transition number. Hence 31.pinned and 32.pinned implies the meshes
                  involved in 3rd transition that are the meshes corresponding to the 3rd and 4th day.

CommonTriangulatedOut --> Contains the commonly triangulated meshes for each pair of transitions as T_00 and T_01 in the output/coarse_to_file folder of each transition pair folder.
